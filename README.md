A website that can be used to generate a random secure password based on user submitted criteria. Supports english alphabet characters, numbers, and special characters.

All HTML and CSS were provided for this homework, along with lines 1-14 of script.js. I implemented the generatePassword function which prompts the user to enter the length of a password
